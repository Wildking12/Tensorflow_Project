# Concepts
## Arificial Intelligence

* The effort to automate intellectual tasks normally performed by humans.
* Back in the day, the computers were given predefined rules by humans which the abode.
* The computer is figuring out how to do something while following an algorithm/rule.
* AI can be simple or complex

## Machine Learning
* The computer takes the data and what the output should be and figures out the rules by itself
* The goal is to create a model that has the highest accuracy possible
* So rather than giving the program the rules, an algorithm finds the rules for us.
* We have 2 layers, an input and output layer and the rules are there to connect the 2 layers

## Neural Network
* A form of machine learning that uses a layered representation of data.
* We have multiple layers <2, we have the input layer and the data will go to another layer, where it will be transformed using a kind of predefined set of rules, while passing through these layers between input and meaningful output, certain features of the data will be extracted and figured out, in the output layer all extracted data will be combined again in a way that it has meaning for the programm or for us.
 
# Example with data
- The input information is called Feature
- The output is called Label
- When we are training we give all the data to the model, features and label
- When we are testing we are only giving the features to the model
